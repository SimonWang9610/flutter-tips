# Project introduction

this project is used to build some fancy Flutter components from scratch. I know there are many existing better packages in `pub.dev`. However, I do believe it is still valuable to understand how I could reproduce them by myself.

Moreover, I also try to share some problems and solutions when coding each components.
I also try to improve and add some documentation and demo images for those components that have been completed for a long time. (such components will be marked `waiting improve and documentation`)

## Try example

Because this project currently is not using any third-party packages and native plugins, so it should run any platform supported by Flutter.

By running this project, you could try supported components that are not marked as `waiting improve and documentation`
